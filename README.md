# Password Generator (Homework-3)
  For the var LowerCase = ["a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z"];
  I used the unicode number to represent the letters and the number of letters for its length.

 For the var UpperCase = ["A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z"];
  I used the unicode number to represent the letters and the number of letters for its length.
  
  For the var number = ["0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9"];
  I used the unicode number to represent the numbers and the total index for its length.
  
  I used var instead of const. to allow for update and changes. 
  
  The block bracket used for arrays did not allow for the symbols to recognised as individual symbols rather it recognised it as a string. 
  Also, because the symbols are sparsely represented in unicode Numbers, I found it quite challenging to respresent them with unicode. 
  
I faced challenges in the loop the Random functions but recall that the random variable will all form a new variable together and used the math function += to resolve the issue I was facing.
